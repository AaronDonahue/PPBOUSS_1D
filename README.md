# PPBOUSS_1D
1-Dimensional SWE + PP solver

This code solves the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) coupled with a pressure-Poisson based Boussinesq type dynamic pressure solver (PP).  See Donahue, A.S., et. al., "A Boussinesq-scaled, pressure-Poisson water wave model", Ocean Modelling, (2015), vol. 86, pp. 36-57 for more details.
